    <h2 style="color: rgb(73, 53, 0);">What are the reasons behind eye flu?</h2>
    <p>Eye flu can be the reason for more than one condition. Some of the possible causes are:</p>

    <ul style="list-style-type:circle;">
        <li>Viruses (Infective conjunctivitis)</li>
        <li>Irritant substances like shampoo, swimming in chlorinated water, and smoke</li>
        <li>Bacteria like gonorrhea and chlamydia</li>
        <li>Allergens like dust, contact lenses, and pollen</li>
    </ul>
<p>Both these conditions are contagious, but these are not that dangerous. In the case of newborns, this condition can be the reason for vision damage. <br>
   If you or anyone in your know has this problem, then consulting one of the Best Eye Doctors in Punjab is how to direct yourself to an effective eyetreatment plan.</p>

    <h2 style="color: rgb(73, 53, 0);">Impact on Nepal</h2>

    <p>Eye flu can spread easily, especially in crowded places. In Nepal, where population density is high, outbreaks can lead to increased healthcare demand. <br>
      Conjunctivitis cases have increased in all seven provinces in recent weeks. According to the Ministry of Health of Nepal, over 10,000 cases of eye flu <br>
      have been registered in just the past month. This contagious eye infection spreads quickly, causing discomfort and inconvenience for those who become infected. <br>
      Dr Pramod Kumar Yadav, Health Secretary of Madhesh Province, said that the ministry has distributed 1 million Ciprofloxacin drops to various eye care <br>
      centres in the province. “We are planning an awareness campaign also so that the public is aware of the spread of the disease,” said Pramod. <br> </p>

    <p>Sindhuli in Bagmati Province has also reported a surge in conjunctivitis patients. According to Bimal Shrestha, manager of Sindhuli Hospital, around 200 to 300 patients <br>
      infected with conjunctivitis have been visiting the hospital daily. “Children are the most affected by conjunctivitis. Most schools in the district have closed down for at <br>
      least a week starting from Monday to avoid the <a href="https://kathmandupost.com/national/2023/08/08/conjunctivitis-spreading-fast-hinting-at-national-outbreak">spread of conjunctivitis </a>in schools,” said Shrestha.
      </p>

    

    <h2 style="color: rgb(73, 53, 0);">Prevention</h2>
    <p>To prevent its spread:</p>
    <ul style="list-style-type: circle;">
        <li>Avoid touching eyes with unwashed hands</li>
        <li>Practice good hygiene</li>
        <li>Use eye protection</li>
        <li>Avoid sharing pillows, towels, and other personal items</li>
        <li>Practice good hygiene, especially during cold and flu season</li>
    </ul>
